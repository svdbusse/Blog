Hi, I'm Stefan van der Busse a Senior Solutions Engineer based in Christchurch, New Zealand.
I work for a National MSP, designing, implementing and supporting solutions for Education, Corporate and Government customers.

I work primarily with Microsoft products, such as:
Windows 10, Azure, Office 365, Azure AD, Intune, PowerShell, SharePoint, App-V, SCCM and Flow.

I'm an ex Windows Phone (RIP) and Microsoft Band (RIP) enthusiast, and now a reluctant iPhone and Apple Watch user.

Information on this site is provided as is, where is and without warranty. If you would like to use some of the solutions listed here, but please ensure your own
