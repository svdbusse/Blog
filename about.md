Hi, I'm Stefan van der Busse a Senior Solutions Engineer based in Christchurch, New Zealand.
I work for a National MSP, designing, implementing and supporting solutions for Education, Corporate and Government customers.

I work primarily with Microsoft products, such as:
Windows 10, Azure, Office 365, Azure AD, Intune, PowerShell, SharePoint, App-V, SCCM and Flow.

I'm an ex Windows Phone (RIP) and Microsoft Band (RIP) enthusiast, and now a reluctant iPhone and Apple Watch consumer.
